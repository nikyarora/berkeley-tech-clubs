## About Us

Codebase is a community of developers that empowers students to break into the software industry. We grow together through hands-on technical projects and striving to provide all students with resources to bridge the gap between academic and practical knowledge.


## Our Projects
The largest component of being a Codebase member is working on our projects. Every semester, Codebase works with four high-growth tech companies and one non-profit organization and builds a technical product for them. Each project team, consisting of two project managers (PMs) and six developers, collaborates closely with their client company’s software engineers through 13 weeks of agile development, complete with sprints, standups, and code reviews. Throughout this process, our members are able to build their foundations in software engineering, learn the best industry practices, and work on a product with immediate feedback and users.

We have two different types of projects: a mentored project for those new to software engineering, as well as client projects for those with more experience.

### Mentored Project
Our mentored project was created as an avenue for students with no industry experience but are interested in software engineering to learn the essentials of web development. Throughout the semester, the two mentored PMs are fully dedicated to teaching you the basics of frontend, backend, and everything in between. Within the first few weeks, developers build their own personal websites, a visualization game, and learn how to interact with APIs, before building their own product from scratch for a non-profit organization.

### Client Projects

For those who have a foundation in software engineering, either through developing a significant project or some industry experience, we run four client teams that each work with a tech company. Going into the project, every developer is quickly onboarded onto their respective tech stacks through a curriculum designed by the PMs, before transitioning to the overall project for the semester.

## Our External Initiatives
Outside of our projects, one of our main initiatives is also to provide the wider Berkeley computer science student body with professional development and mentorship resources. This semester, we’re planning a wide variety of remote events, from company tech talks to industry panels. For those who prefer to learn on their own terms, we are also aiming to start publishing our mentored project curriculum, as well as a comprehensive guide on how to start your own tech organization. If you’re interested in any of these initiatives, keep a lookout on our website and Facebook page for updates!
