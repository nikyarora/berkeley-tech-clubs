## About Us

We are a student-run organization based at the University of California, Berkeley dedicated to building and fostering a vibrant machine learning community on campus while contributing to the greater machine learning community beyond. Our community is comprised of undergraduate and graduate students working on machine learning **industry** consulting projects, cutting-edge academic machine learning **research**, and **educational** initiatives to make machine learning more accessible to the greater Berkeley community and beyond.

## Industry Consulting Projects Highlight

Our collaborations with industry partners is one of our three pillars mentioned above. Here are a few highlights of some past industry projects:

- *[Fall 2019/Spring 2020]* NASA ([https://nasa.gov/](https://nasa.gov/)//)—onboard NASA’s ships, NASA uses RFID chips to keep track of major objects. However, there is a long delay between the reading of the positions of these objects. Deep Learning is necessary to interpolate the position of the static “benchmark” RFID tags. Our team developed an optimal solution for NASA for this task

- *[Fall 2019]* Vyrill ([https://vyrill.com/](https://vyrill.com/)//)—given a Youtube video about a company’s product, we applied NLP to determine the sentiment of each comment towards the subject of the video, and quantify the strength of this sentiment. We then aggregated the comments’ sentiment to get an aggregate reaction to the video itself

- *[Fall 2020]* Copliot ([https://copilotai.com/](https://copilotai.com/)//)—Copilot offers sales people cue cards which pop up during key moments in sales calls, highlighting the information they need. We applied sentence and word modeling to find the most applicable information for a given point in the call.

## Research Projects Highlight

Complementing our industry projects are our research projects, where we work together with PhDs or research scientists at Google Brain or FAIR on machine learning problems at the frontier of research. Here's a few of our recent projects that ML@B problems devised and worked on themselves. 

- *[Fall 2020]* Semantic Convolutions—we set out to improve the interpretability of convolutional networks, hoping to go beyond the traditional intuition of CNNs being just stacked progressively refining feature detector layers since it is quite brittle in practice. We ended with Capsule Networks as our primary research direction and iterated upon a Google Brain paper to try and make Capsule nets competitive with plain CNNs

- *[Spring 2020]* Self-supervised EEG—EEG brain signals measure the brain’s electrical activity, but applications of deep learning have been limited due to the expensive manual process of labeling sequences. We created an open source implementation of self-supervised techniques to develop latent representations instead! These can be used for downstream classification tasks with limited supervision

## Education Initiatives

Education has long been at the heart of what we do in ML@B. We want to educate the masses, and that only happens when we dream big. You'll see that many of our initiatives below reflect that mentality.

- DeCals—a major part of our external education efforts, we offer these member-led courses to the wider Berkeley community. Topics of past classes include: Machine Learning in Healthcare, Self-Driving Cars, and Ethics in AI
- EdX—a new initiative this semester, we are working with BerkeleyX to publish a sponsored and certified Massively Open Online Course to the EdX platform
- Reading Groups—big contributor to our ongoing member education, reading groups are presentations and discussion sessions centered on an academic paper or general topic
- Workshops—like reading groups, workshops are internal presentations and discussions that allow ML@B members to keep learning. These sessions focus on sharing skills and wisdom of our older members

## New Member Experience

When you first join ML@B, you will apply to do one of the following based on experience level:

- take part in the New Member Education Program,
- an industry or research project, or
- become a project manager.

Those with enough experience can just jump right into our projects every semester. For the members who join NMEP (majority of each new member class), you will spend a semester learning and then end it with a final group project. After this first semester, you will be able to join an industry/research project as well as a committee of your choosing (as long as you did all your homework of course). For an example of an NMEP Project from Fall 2020, check out [this presentation]([https://youtu.be/WxVq0wJKh8o?t=709](https://youtu.be/WxVq0wJKh8o?t=709)99) the Video Gesture overlay team did on their Zoom overlay for video gestures. 

## ML@B Community

While ML@B is great for professional opportunities and all, most of our members would say the best thing about the club is the awesome community. We have a big team of officers dedicated to building a strong community through:

- *Socials:* Even during the pandemic, we are hosting at least one social a week to make sure everyone feels connected. Past online socials include codenames, jackbox games, among us, and even a custom murder mystery painstakingly planned by our internal officers. Past IRL socials, which we hope to continue as soon as possible, include ice skating, SF trips, bowling, taco tuesday, and much more.
- *Retreat:* Every (non-covid) semester, we hold a retreat in some cool location. I made some of my best friends during my first retreat, and have so many fun stories. We also hope to continue with in-person retreats as soon as possible!
- *Big-little program:* Every new member gets paired with a big each semester, and we plan fun activities around these fams (including competitions w/ prizes).

We all can’t wait to meet our newest members!
