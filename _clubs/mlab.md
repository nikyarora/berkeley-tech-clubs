## Who Are We

We are a student-run organization based at the University of California, Berkeley dedicated to building and fostering a vibrant machine learning community on campus while contributing to the greater machine learning community beyond. Our community is comprised of undergraduate and graduate students working on machine learning industry consulting projects, cutting-edge academic machine learning research, and educational initiatives to make machine learning more accessible to the greater Berkeley community and beyond.
