## Our Club

Extended Reality @ Berkeley is a student group dedicated to bringing virtual reality to the campus community. Our club provides students with access to virtual reality equipment and training and charters project teams to explore the applications and implications of virtual reality in diverse fields through research and development. By providing access to hardware and expertise, we aim to lower the barriers to experiencing and developing virtual reality technology. We are partnering with established labs on campus to investigate virtual and augmented reality as tools for robotics control systems, visualization of complex data, and as an interface for the future. We engage with the campus community through public demo days and infosessions.

## Project Teams

Dive straight into developing with us. We're expanding the horizons on HCI and interfaces with AR drone interactions, creating fluid hand-tracking interfaces, fliming stunning 360 cinemas, tackling SLAM challenges in mobile AR, and helping visualize CRISPR's innovative technology - to name a few. Find out more about our Fall 2020 project teams [here](https://xr.berkeley.edu/index.html#projects).

## VR DeCal

VR / AR is one of the hottest growing industries in computing, consumer technology, and is rapidly advancing computer vision. Its applications range from entertainment to medical. If you have a background in CS, have dabbled in Unity, and want to take it to the next step - join us and we'll teach you the rest. Find out more about our DeCal [here](https://xr.berkeley.edu/decal/).

## ROAR Decal

Robot Autonomous Racing DeCal is a course dedicated to teaching students to gain a holistic view and hands-on experiences about building a high-performance fully-autonomous 1/10 scale RC car from scratch. The one-semester course is built on the matured Berkeley BARC platform in the ME Department and the ROAR platform and its racing events in the EECS Department. Students will learn:

* How to assemble a mobile AI system with embedded Arduino and Jetson Nano processors, peripheral power supplies, and Wi-Fi 6 antenna modules. 
* 3D print enclosures of the embedded components onto a high-speed Traxxas RC chassis.
* Real-time 3D computer vision algorithms to parse road conditions and autonomous control algorithms to race on a track and avoid obstacles.
* Using low-latency video streaming to remote control the car in virtual reality.
* And other interesting topics surrounding robotics, planning, etc.

At the end of the semester, students will team up using their fully-fledged racing car to participate in the ROAR competition. Find out more on the [ROAR DeCal website](https://roar-decal.github.io/index.html).
