## 📈 Our Mission

MDB is a vibrant, open community of developers seeking to drive change within and outside of Berkeley. Our community fosters a passion for innovative ideas, inventive solutions for our clients, and exceptional development at large. MDB is a defining part of our Berkeley experience and continues to impact the lives of our members through an inclusive and supportive family far beyond the walls of the university.

## 🌱 New Member Experience

Your first semester in MDB will consist of a new member training program, an intensive, rigorous, and all-inclusive mobile development program that all new members participate in. 

You will have the option of pursuing [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) or [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/) development and by the end of the semester you will have made significant progress towards publishing your first mobile application to the App Store.

## 📱 Club Opportunities

After your semester, you can choose to join one of the following branches of the organization:

1. 🧑‍💻 DevCore: Within DevCore, members work on personal projects and spend time experimenting with new technologies. While some members continue working on mobile projects, many have worked on machine learning, AR, VR, hardware, web applications, and much more!
2. 💼 Contract: Contract is our professional services branch in which companies will hire us to build there mobile application. Our members control the entire process including the initial ideation and designs, the development, and the deployment onto the app store. Contract gives members a unique, industry-level experience.
3. 🧑‍🏫 Training Program: Members who are interested in education can choose to return to training program and work on creating new content for the program, being an instructor, or being a mentor.

MDB also hosts the annual [Berkeley Techfair](https://techfair.dev)

## 🎉 Community
One of the best things about MDB is our club's community! Through our Big-Little program, Retreats, Game Nights, and numerous other Socials, you can find you family here at Cal.
