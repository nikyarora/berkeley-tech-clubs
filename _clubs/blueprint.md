## About Us

Blueprint is a community of students that build technology for social good. Each year we partner with five nonprofit organizations and our teams of developers and designers work to identify and build a solution to a core problem they have. Our external team leads conversations around ethical engineering through our events, content, and community outreach.

## Fall 2020 Projects

This year, weâ€™re proud to work with five nonprofits with causes ranging from building safe networks for Black LGBTQ/SGL people to reducing maternal mortality. You can read all about them in our [latest medium article](https://medium.com/blueprint/introducing-our-projects-for-2020-2021-8ca0be9bf852). Below is a brief overview of each one.
